# Investment in additional technology, or wearables, to assist coaching and player development.

**DISCLAIMER:**
This information has been complied from reviewing vendor websites, online articles, promotional videos and webinars. It isn't written by an expert, nor a sports professional, nor a journalist. Just a parent trying to provide context. It is recommended that the vendors are engaged to help make future comparison. Also additional inputs of real usage are incorporated.

## Context and Problem Statement

Twelve months ago the team invested in a [Veo Camera](http://veo.co/), this has been regularly used to record our games and provide individual coaching  insight. To keep the camera operational we need to renew the annual subscription. So we are looking to raise the funds from both parents and outside of the club. 

At the same time we are reviewing whether we should purchase additonal equipment to help improve player development.

- What other equipment would be useful?
- What does it offer?
- How much does it cost?
- Does it compliment or overlay with existing equipment?


## Decision Drivers

* Features - focus on stats that are more relevent to football coaching
* Cost - the one off and ongoing cost of ownership
* Complimentary - does it work well with existing 

## Considered Options

* GPS
* GPS + Heart Rate
* Foot Wearable

## Recommended decision Outcome

This decision is the reserve of the coaches. 

The opinion below is of the author, after spending a day consuming this information.

Recommended option: "Foot Wearable", because:
- it had minimal overlap with the benefits/features of Veo
- it is built for football
- it is the cheapest (and players parents are the main source of income)

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Vest with GPS tracker

Vest with GPS tracker, such as the Stats Sports Apex Athlete - GPS Performance Tracker, or Catapult PlayerTek+/One.

These devices track distance covered over time, which allow the coaches to view statitics such as:
* Accelerations and Decelerations
* Average pace
* Calories
* Distance per miniute
* Max Speed
* Total distance 
* Sprint count
* High Intensity Distance

StatSport costs £200 and has no subscription costs.
Catapult cost £159 but has a subscription cost of around £80 (based on price comparison of 12-24 months with device).

#### Good vs Bad

* Good, because broad range of distance metrics
* Good, because its focus is on movement and fitness
* Good, because it can plot team movement on a field of play
* Good, because it can be used in other sports and exercises
* Good, because it is one payment and done
* Bad, because it doesn't track ball stats
* Bad, because it only tracks movement stats
* Bad, becuase it overlaps with the tracking and movement analysis of Veo

### Vest with GPS tracker and Heart rate monitor

Vest with GPS tracker (see above) and a Heart rate monitor. Only StatSport product supports both GPS and Heart reate.

These devices in addition to the list for GPS allow the coaches to view statitics such as:
* GPS Stats above and 
* Current Heart Rate
* Average Heart Rate
* Max Heart Rate
* Time in Red Zone

#### Good vs Bad

See GPS. With additional points below

* Good, because covers heart rate
* Good, because easier to track fitness over training, matches and season
* Good, because teaches players about their fitness and body/heart rate
* Bad, because it's additional cost

StatSport costs £220 but has no subscription costs.
Catapult PlayerTek supports this but prices aren't listed (expected to be £250 is based on US costs) - this also has an additional subscription cost (also not known).

### Foot Wearable

Device strapped to both feet. See comparison on [playermaker](https://www.playermaker.com/how-it-works/) website at bottom of page 

These devices essentially record foot impact giving coaches the following information:
* Touches
* Ball Releases
* Possession
* One Touch
* Short Possession
* Long Possession
* Touch by leg
* Release by leg
* Receive by leg
* Max kicking velocity
* Top Speed
* Sprints
* Accelerations and Decelerations
* Distance Covered
* Sprint Distance
* Work rate

#### Good vs Bad

* Good, because it focuses more on football stats
* Good, because it focuses more on player technic and control
* Good, because it can estimate some distance figures
* Good, very little overlap with Veo functionality
* Bad, because can only estimate distance figures
* Bad, because cannot record pitch location
* Bad, because when they can fall out, we will all be roooting around the mud looking for the sensor

Cost is expected to be £150 (£167 at sports direct). That includes a one year subscription, on going subscription cost isn't known at this time.
